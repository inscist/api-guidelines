# Inscist REST API Guidelines
The [Inscist REST API Guidelines](Guidelines.md) are Inscist's internal company-wide REST API design guidelines.
Teams at Inscist typically reference this document when setting API design policy.
They may additionally create documents specific to their team, adding further guidance or making adjustments as appropriate to their circumstances.

We publish these guidelines here with the aim of fostering dialogue and learning in the API community at large.
We further hope that these guidelines may encourage other organizations to create guidelines that are appropriate for them and in turn, if they are able, to publish theirs.

### Inspired by Microsoft
These guidelines were heavily inspired by the [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines). For the most part, we have kept the original guidelines intact. To see the changes we have made, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
